# Fast_NN_Search

A C++ application using SDL2 to visualize and benchmark nearest-neighbor search algorithms.

## ❗️ Prerequisites

This project is built for a **64-bit Windows environment** using the **MinGW-w64 compiler**.

Before you can compile you MUST have a 64-bit C++ compiler. If your compiler is 32-bit (`mingw32`) this will not compile.

There is no need to download sdl2 libraries as we have included those in the repo itself.

## 🚀 How to Compile and Run

This repository includes all necessary 64-bit libraries, fonts, and DLLs.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Prajwal712/Fast_NN_Search.git](https://github.com/Prajwal712/Fast_NN_Search.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd Fast_NN_Search
    ```

3.  **Run the compile script:**

    ```sh
    .\compile.bat
    ```

    This will create `my_map_app.exe`.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    .\my_map_app.exe
    ```
