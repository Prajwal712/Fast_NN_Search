##Fast_NN_Search

A project to implement, visualize, and compare k-d trees and quadtrees for efficient storage and retrieval of point coordinates.

Overview

This repository contains the implementation of two spatial data structures: the k-d tree and the quadtree. The primary goal is to efficiently store 2D point coordinates to perform fast Nearest Neighbor (NN) searches.

We provide a user interface (UI) to visualize these data structures and their operations. The project also includes a comparative analysis of their time complexities for operations like insertion and searching, aiming to determine the optimal structure for different scenarios.

🌲 Features

K-D Tree: Implementation of a k-dimensional tree (specialized for 2D).

Quadtree: Implementation of a quadtree for spatial indexing.

User Interface: A visual tool to interact with and understand how both data structures partition the 2D space.

Performance Analysis: Code and analysis to compare the time complexities of both structures for key operations.

🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to:

Implement k-d trees and quadtrees from scratch.

Develop a UI that helps visualize their construction and search processes.

Benchmark the performance (especially time complexity) of both data structures for insertion, deletion, and nearest neighbor search.

Conclude which structure is "best" based on empirical data and theoretical analysis, considering factors like data distribution and density.
